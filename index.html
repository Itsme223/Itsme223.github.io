            <h1>Doctor Who and Tardis</h1>
            <p>Doctor Who is a British science-fiction television programme produced by the BBC since 1963. The programme depicts the adventures of a Time Lord called "the Doctor", an extraterrestrial being from the planet Gallifrey. The Doctor explores the universe in a time-travelling space ship called the TARDIS. Its exterior appears as a blue British police box, which was a common sight in Britain in 1963 when the series first aired. Accompanied by a number of companions, the Doctor combats a variety of foes, while working to save civilisations and help people in need.</p>

        <h1>Where To Start?</h1>
        <p>Doctor Who started in 1963, making it the longest running Sci-fi to date.  There have been at least 14 actors to take up the role of the Doctor, along with over a dozen side-characters or companions who help out the Doctor in every adventure.</p>

        <p>As big as this show is, it leaves us wondering
            <span>Where Do I Start?</span></p>

        <ul class="Newbies">
        <h1>Newbies</h1>
        <li><h2>Series 1, Episode 1</h2>-"Rose"</li>
        <li><h2>Series 3, Episode 10</h2>-"Blink"</li>
        <li><h2>Series 5, Episode 1</h2>-"Eleventh Hour"</li>
    </ul>

    <ul class="Somewhat">
        <h1>Somewhat Familiar</h1>
        <li><h2>Series 3, Episode 10</h2>-"Blink"</li>
        <li><h2>Series 6, Episode 11</h2>-"God Complex"</li>
        <li><h2>Series 8, Episode 1</h2>-"Deep Breath"</li>  
    </ul>

        <p>Included are two suggested playlists. The first one ( Newbies) is for those fans who are starting the show for the first time. The second playlist ( Somewhat familiar) is for the people who are kind of familiar with the show. Each playlist consits of 3 episodes from the "New Who" era of episodes ( Starting in 2005). Below is a playlist for those who want to binge watch full season of Doctor Who. An alternative to this playlist is to just watch season 1 - 9 ( including the specials in between each season).   </p>

        
            
        <p>After you have gotten through either of the first two playlists. You may be left wondering,
            <span>"Where do I go from here?"</span></p>

        <p>If you want to start from the beginning, it would be best to start with the shows revival in 2005 and progress from there.If you find that you do not have the time or patience to do that. Then you can follow the playlist below, which shows the best order to watch the seasons in, including those episodes you can avoid. The following playlist has all the seasons starting in the revival of the series in 2005.

        <h1>Regeneration</h1>
        <p>Regeneration is a biological ability exhibited by the Time Lords, a race of fictional humanoids originating on the planet Gallifrey. This process allows a Time Lord to undergo a transformation into a new physical form and a somewhat different personality after instances which would normally result in death. Regeneration has been used twelve times throughout the history of the franchise as a device for introducing a new actor for the lead role of it's main character, the Doctor. Other Time Lords and similar characters have also regenerated, usually for narrative, rather than casting, reasons.
