            <h1>Doctor Who and Tardis</h1>
            <p>Doctor Who is a British science-fiction television programme produced by the BBC since 1963. The programme depicts the adventures of a Time Lord called "the Doctor", an extraterrestrial being from the planet Gallifrey. The Doctor explores the universe in a time-travelling space ship called the TARDIS. Its exterior appears as a blue British police box, which was a common sight in Britain in 1963 when the series first aired. Accompanied by a number of companions, the Doctor combats a variety of foes, while working to save civilisations and help people in need.</p>

            <p>Doctor Who was first aired in 1963, it was intended to be a kids show. Where parents and kids would travel the universe with the Doctor to learn about science. With the inclusion on different creatures and enemies( like the Dalex)</p>

            <p>In 2013, Doctor Who celebrated it's 50th Anniversary. It aired a 77 minute special, named: <span>Day Of The Doctor</span>. This special was in multiple outlets around the world. It was played in theatres around world, simulcasted on multiple television channels. The 50th anniversary special told a story that involved three Doctors(War Doctor, 10th and 11th Doctor), working together to deal with a large problem that could destroy the Earth. This special also used refrences from past episodes in the series.</p>

     <div class="Start" id="Start">
            
        <h1>Where To Start?</h1>
        <p>Doctor Who started in 1963, making ir the longest running Sci-fi to date. Although the show has been cancelled twice ( 1963 and 1996), that still leaves over 50 years of story. With at least 14 actors to take up the role of the Doctor, along with over a dozen side-characters or companionswho help out the Doctor in every adventure.</p>

        <p>Its understandable that not everyone is going to want to start with the first episode of Doctor Who(back in 1963) and wants to jump in to see the good stuff. At the same time, there are those who have heard rumors of the show through friends and want to jump in when its convient and has their "Favorite Doctor". Knowing all this is, the big question is <span>Where Do I Start?</span></p>

        <ul class="Newbies">
        <h1>Newbies</h1>
        <li>Series 1, Episode 1-"Rose"</li>
        <li>Series 3, Episode 10-"Blink"</li>
        <li>Series 5, Episode 1-"Eleventh Hour"</li>
    </ul>

    <ul class="Somewhat">
        <h1>Somewhat Familiar</h1>
        <li>Series 3, Episode 10-"Blink"</li>
        <li>Series 6, Episode 11-"God Complex"</li>
        <li>Series 8, Episode 1-"Deep Breath"</li>  
    </ul>

        <p>Included are two suggested playlists. The first one ( Newbies) is for those fans who are starting the show for the first time. The second playlist ( Somewhat familiar) is for the for people who are kind of familiar with the show having seen episodes in no order. Each Playlist consits of 3 episodes from the "New Who" era of episodes ( Starting in 2000). Below is a playlist for those who want to binge watch full season of Doctor Who, an alternative to this playlist is to just watch season 1 - 9( including the specials in between each season)   </p>

        
            
        <p>After you have gotten through either of the first two playlists. You may be left wondering,<span>"Where do I go from here?"</span> Do I have to start back at the 1963, episode 1 or the 2005 episode 1? Can I skip ahead to the current Doctor and try to figure out stuff that way? Although you can start from the 1963 season one episodes, it is not recommended because those episodes are from a diffrent time period and may not have as much validity as in our time period. If you want to start from the beginning, it would be best to start with the shows revival in 2005 and progress through every season from there.</p>
        <p>If you find that you do not have the time or patience to do that. The you can follow the playlist below, which lays out the best order to watch these seasons in, including those you can avoid. The following playlist is all the seasons starting in the revival of the series in 2005.

        <h1>Regeneration</h1>
        <p>In the long-running British science fiction television series Doctor Who, regeneration is a biological ability exhibited by the Time Lords, a race of fictional humanoids originating on the planet Gallifrey. This process allows a Time Lord to undergo a transformation into a new physical form and a somewhat different personality after instances which would normally result in death. Regeneration has been used twelve times throughout the history of the franchise as a device for introducing a new actor for the lead role of its main character, the Doctor. Other Time Lords and similar characters have also regenerated, usually for narrative, rather than casting, reasons.

                        Dr Who is an amazing tv series. The show itself is very unique in that it routinely changes. In particular this includes the actors that play the main roles such as Doctor Who. However, the main premise remains that saving planets, civilizations, timelines, the doctor does it all. The series has lasted the test of time and is definitely a must watch for any fan of the Science fiction genre.
